# TOPDRAWER for Mac

The tools allows to display topdrawer files on Mac OS X.

## What is topdrawer?
[1] puts it like this
> Top Drawer is a program developed at SLAC to display the kinds of data that physicists produce. It makes histograms, scatter plots, data points with error bars and plot symbols, curves passing through data points, and elaborate titles.

## What does this tool?
Many MC generators like [MCFM](http://mcfm.fnal.gov) produce their final histograms as topdrawer files. Displaying those can be inconvenient on a Mac system. 

Using these tools, *.top files can be displayed using QuickView and an native app.

## Requirements
 - python (at least 2.7) with modules re, sys and subprocess
 - ps2pdf (for export function)
 - gnuplot supporting svg and PostScript export
